# Welcome to Project N.O.M.A.D.

Your personal offline knowledge server is ready to use.

## What is N.O.M.A.D.?

**N.O.M.A.D.** stands for **Node for Offline Media, Archives, and Data**. It's your personal server for accessing knowledge, education, and AI assistance — even when you have no internet connection.

Think of it as having Wikipedia, Khan Academy, an AI assistant, and offline maps all in one place, running on hardware you control.

## What Can You Do?

### Browse Offline Knowledge
Access millions of Wikipedia articles, medical references, how-to guides, and ebooks — all stored locally on your server. No internet required.

*Launch the Information Library from the home screen or the [Apps](/settings/apps) page.*

### Learn Something New
Khan Academy courses covering math, science, economics, and more. Complete with videos and exercises, all available offline.

*Launch the Education Platform from the home screen or the [Apps](/settings/apps) page.*

### Chat with AI
Ask questions, get explanations, brainstorm ideas, or get help with writing. Your local AI assistant works completely offline — and you can upload documents to the Knowledge Base for document-aware responses.

**[Open AI Chat →](/chat)**

### Upload Documents to the Knowledge Base
Upload PDFs, text files, and other documents for the AI to reference. The Knowledge Base uses semantic search to find relevant information from your uploaded documents when you ask questions.

**[Open Knowledge Base →](/knowledge-base)**

### View Offline Maps
Navigate and explore maps without an internet connection. Download regions you need before going offline.

**[Open Maps →](/maps)**

### Benchmark Your Hardware
Run a System Benchmark to see how your hardware performs and compare your NOMAD Score with the community leaderboard.

## Keeping Your Server Updated

N.O.M.A.D. works best when kept up to date while you have internet access. This ensures you have the latest:
- Software features and bug fixes
- Wikipedia and reference content
- Educational materials
- AI model improvements

When you go offline, you'll have everything you need — the last synced versions of all your content.
