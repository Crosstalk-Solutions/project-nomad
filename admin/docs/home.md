# Welcome to Project N.O.M.A.D.

Your personal offline knowledge server is ready to use.

## What is N.O.M.A.D.?

**N.O.M.A.D.** stands for **Node for Offline Media, Archives, and Data**. It's your personal server for accessing knowledge, education, and AI assistance — even when you have no internet connection.

Think of it as having Wikipedia, Khan Academy, an AI assistant, and offline maps all in one place, running on hardware you control.

## What Can You Do?

### Browse Offline Knowledge
Access millions of Wikipedia articles, medical references, how-to guides, and ebooks — all stored locally on your server. No internet required.

### Learn Something New
Khan Academy courses covering math, science, economics, and more. Complete with videos and exercises, all available offline.

**[Open Kolibri →](/kolibri)**

### Chat with AI
Ask questions, get explanations, brainstorm ideas, or get help with writing. Your local AI assistant works completely offline.

## Keeping Your Server Updated

N.O.M.A.D. works best when kept up to date while you have internet access. This ensures you have the latest:
- Software features and bug fixes
- Wikipedia and reference content
- Educational materials
- AI model improvements

When you go offline, you'll have everything you need — the last synced versions of all your content.
