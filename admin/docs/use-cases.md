## Setting Up for Your Use Case

### Step 1: Identify Your Needs
What situations might you face without internet? What information would you need?

### Step 2: Prioritize Content
Storage is limited. Focus on:
1. Critical safety information (medical, emergency)
2. Content matching your primary use case
3. General reference (Wikipedia)
4. Nice-to-have additions

### Step 3: Upload Relevant Documents
Add your own documents to the [Knowledge Base](/knowledge-base) — emergency plans, technical manuals, curriculum guides, or research papers. The AI can reference these when you ask questions.

### Step 4: Download While You Can
Keep your server updated while you have internet. You never know when you'll need to go offline.

### Step 5: Practice
Try using N.O.M.A.D. before you need it. Familiarity with the tools makes them more useful in a crisis.
