# About Project N.O.M.A.D.

Project N.O.M.A.D. (Node for Offline Media, Archives, and Data; "Nomad" for short) is a project started in 2025 by Chris Sherwood of [Crosstalk Solutions, LLC.](https://crosstalksolutions.com). The goal of the project is not to create just another utility for storing offline resources, but rather to allow users to run their own ultime "survival computer".

While many similar offline survival computers are designed to be run on bare-minimum, lightweight hardware, Project N.O.M.A.D. is quite the opposite. To install and run the available AI tools, we highly encourage the use of a beefy, GPU-backed device to make the most of your install.
